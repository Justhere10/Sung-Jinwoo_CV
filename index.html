                <p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whx0WCtc9DQ">Sung Jinwoo</a></strong> <em>(성진우)</em> is the main
                    protagonist of Solo Leveling. Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, he got the chance of a lifetime when he
                    was selected as the Player of the System, giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. As a
                    result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power as
                    humanity's greatest hunter and the second Shadow Monarch.</p>
